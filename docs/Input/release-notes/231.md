## Core
* [Fix] Message bus named events were not being published properly [GH-772](https://github.com/shinyorg/shiny/issues/772)
* [Fix] Android 11+ opens a complete app when requesting permissions for location, thus permission requests could fail on Shiny in race scenarios.  Shiny no longer checks if the request is made on the foreground
* [Fix] Message bus named broadcast was not publishing [GH-772](https://github.com/shinyorg/shiny/issues/772)

## Locations
* [Fix][Android] Location permissions for background must be done separate from other permissions now as per Android 11+
* [Fix][Android] Locations permission on Android 12 requires coarse & fine permissions, even if you only need fine

## Notifications
* [Fix][Android] Channels were not being set [GH-774](https://github.com/shinyorg/shiny/pull/774)

### HTTP Transfers
* [Fix][Android] Add postdata to uploads multipart content [GH-761](https://github.com/shinyorg/shiny/discussions/761)
* [Fix][Android] Ensure final response from upload is successful [GH-771](https://github.com/shinyorg/shiny/pull/771)
