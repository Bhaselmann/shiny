## Core
* [Fix] Message bus named events were not being published properly [GH-772](https://github.com/shinyorg/shiny/issues/772)
* [Fix] Android 11+ opens a complete app when requesting permissions for location, thus permission requests could fail on Shiny in race scenarios.  Shiny no longer checks if the request is made on the foreground
* [Fix] Message bus named broadcast was not publishing [GH-772](https://github.com/shinyorg/shiny/issues/772)

## BluetoothLE
* [Fix][Android] Background permission is no longer inserted into the manifest

## Locations
* [Fix][Android] Location permissions for background must be done separate from other permissions now as per Android 11+

* [Fix][iOS] Background was not respecting deferrals [GH-783](https://github.com/shinyorg/shiny/issues/783)
* [Enhancement][Android] Background permission is no longer enforced on package, but will throw an exception if it is requested and not put in the manifest
* [Enhancement][Android] Motion activity permission is no longer inserted automatically into your AndroidManifest.xml.  An exception is thrown in its place if it is not present in the manifest when it is requested.
* [Enhancement][Android] GpsRequest now has GpsBackgroundMode (None, Standard, RealTime).  Realtime creates the foreground service & background is a periodic ping with GPS coordinates
* [Enhancement][iOS][Android] GpsRequest now has Precise (Android: Fine) that (on Android requests) ensures fine requirements are met or at least return AccessState.Restricted when they are not
