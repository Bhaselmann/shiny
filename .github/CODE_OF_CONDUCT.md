# Code of Conduct

REMEMBER - this is a free project you use - the maintainers are not here to look into a crystal ball or take any form of abuse.  This is not a product, it is something that is given away for free.

* Be respectful
* Be concise by providing as much information as possible such as code samples, FULL stack traces, etc - stating that you've followed docs/samples/etc is just not good enough
* Reply to questions back from the maintainer if you want your issue resolved
* Issues are not taken for documentation, samples, tests, etc - only PRs
* Issues are only taken for the latest STABLE version of the library - preview versions of the library can be discussed on the SponsorConnect Discord channel available to sponsors only
* Since UWP is essentially being killed, only PR's are accepted or tier 3 sponsors can post issues for UWP.  I also don't use UWP in ANY professional applications, so the time needs to be justified
* Issues that contain "Mono.Linker.MarkException: Error processing method: '*****' in assembly" are something you need to learn to setup in your release versions.  You need to read the documentation from Microsoft here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/cross-platform/deploy-test/linker
* No requests will be taken for the following
    * Library Updates
    * Documentation Updates
    * Support for libraries not listed in the product selection
    * Timelines
